# BrightSec Scan Automation Project
This project automates the processes of creating BrightSec projects, running discovery scans, retrieving entry points, and initiating Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) scans. It leverages BrightSecâ€™s API and Python scripts to streamline security workflows, making it ideal for CI/CD pipelines or security operations.

### Overview
BrightSec Scan Automation Project simplifies BrightSec API integrations to reduce repetitive tasks. The scripts provide a complete workflow from creating projects to performing targeted scans on specific entry points.

### Features
Automated Project Creation: Create BrightSec projects in bulk with group associations.
Discovery Scans: Identify and map application entry points efficiently.
Entry Point Filtering: Target specific URLs for customized scans.
Scan Automation: Execute DAST scans on selected or all entry points.
Pagination Handling: Fetch data without losing information in large datasets.
Dynamic Configurations: Customize parameters like scan names, project IDs, and entry points.
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later installed.
- BrightSec API key with appropriate permissions.
- Access to BrightSec projects and configurations.
- Required Python libraries (argparse, requests, etc.).
### Scripts Overview
1. Project Creation Script
File: create_project.py

Reads project names from a file and creates projects in BrightSec.
Associates projects with specific group IDs.
Introduces a delay to avoid API rate-limiting.
Execution Example:
`python create_project.py --apiKey <API_KEY> --groupIds <GROUP_IDS> --projectFile <FILE_PATH>`
2. Discovery Scan Script
File: create_discovery.py

Initiates discovery scans to map entry points and subdomains.
Supports custom configurations for optimized crawling.
Execution Example:

`python create_discovery.py --apiKey <API_KEY> --projectId <PROJECT_ID> --targetUrl <TARGET_URL> --nameDiscovery <DISCOVERY_NAME>`
3. Entry Points Fetch and Filter Script
File: run_ep_scan.py and filter_ep_run_scan.py 

First one is running scan based on all enterypoints found, second one is going to filter the enterypoints(for now containing "hm") and run the scan.
Retrieves all entry points for a project and filters them based on specified criteria.
Handles pagination to ensure all entry points are fetched.
Execution Example:

`python run_ep_scan.py --apiKey <API_KEY> --projectId <PROJECT_ID> --filter "specific-string"`
4. Scan Automation Scripts
Files: run_scan.py and run_ep_scan_from_file.py 

Automate DAST scans using either a file-based entry point list or filtered entry points.
Construct detailed payloads for customized scan execution.
Execution Example (File-Based):

`python run_ep_scan_from_file.py --apiKey <API_KEY> --scanName <SCAN_NAME> --projectId <PROJECT_ID> --entrypointsFile <FILE_PATH>`
### Usage Examples
- Create Projects from File:
Use create_project.py to create multiple projects based on a text file.

- Run a Discovery Scan:
Initiate a scan to identify all application entry points with create_discovery.py.

- Filter and Scan Entry Points:
Target specific URLs by filtering entry points with run_ep_scan.py and execute a focused scan.

- Scan Entry Points from File:
Load entry points from a file and initiate a scan using run_ep_scan_from_file.py.

#### Error Handling
API Request Failures: Logs detailed error messages with HTTP status codes and responses.
File Handling Errors: Ensures user-friendly feedback for missing or malformed files.
Graceful Exit: Provides meaningful logs for troubleshooting without abrupt terminations.
### Use Cases
Automate security scanning as part of CI/CD pipelines.
Manage large BrightSec projects with minimal manual intervention.
Perform targeted scans on specific application sections.
Simplify onboarding for new applications into the BrightSec platform.
